Yes! A couple of times.
I am a DBA and I have good knowledge of windows administration. I do have a good mastery of virtualizing an environment, building a cluster, manage virtual machines. 
We once had this issue where the main guy was out for PTO and the company badly needed too test this application. The support guy was as well not available.
I was able to spin in there and help. They knew that I am very familiar with things like that as I owned my own home lab where I do a lot of hands-on training to develop and grow.
I spin up the VM, created a cluster for the testing and the proof of concept team came in and we tested and confirm the app was working.
They were very happy as they did not expect a DBA will be able to go that far to do such.

I have as well been able to cover for colleagues that have not been able to work and I step in and rescue the situation and I make everything is working smoothly. This is my personality and I enjoy working this way.
This way, I have been praised highly for this.
